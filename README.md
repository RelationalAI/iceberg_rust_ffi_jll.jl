# `iceberg_rust_ffi_jll.jl` custom builds

This is a *custom* version of https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/iceberg_rust_ffi_jll.jl, autogenerated package constructed using [`BinaryBuilder.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl).
The custom version is intended for internal use when you want to build a custom version the JLL. In order to do that, run the `build-and-deploy` workflow, and it will:

* Modify `iceberg_rust_ffi_binarybuilder/build_tarballs.jl` with the passed in version and commit SHA of the https://github.com/RelationalAI/iceberg_rust_ffi repo.
* Deploy a new release. Make sure to pass in unique version number to the GitHub workflow.
* Produce a new branch with JLLWrappers around the artifacts in that release

To later use this, just reference this repostitory from your Julia, and the commit from the newly produced branch.
